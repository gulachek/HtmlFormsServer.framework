## libarchive/archive_getdate.c

This code is in the public domain and has no copyright.

This is a plain C recursive-descent translation of an old
public-domain YACC grammar that has been used for parsing dates in
very many open-source projects.

Since the original authors were generous enough to donate their
work to the public domain, I feel compelled to match their
generosity.

Tim Kientzle, February 2009.

Header comment from original getdate.y:

Originally written by Steven M. Bellovin <smb@research.att.com> while
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Later tweaked by
a couple of people on Usenet.  Completely overhauled by Rich $alz
<rsalz@bbn.com> and Jim Berets <jberets@bbn.com> in August, 1990;

This grammar has 10 shift/reduce conflicts.

This code is in the public domain and has no copyright.
